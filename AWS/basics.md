ðŸ“Œ What is Cloud Computing?

A delivery of compute resources over the internet is called as cloud computing. Lets take look at some of these resources.

- Compute : EC2, Lambda. etc...
- Network : VPC, Direct Connect, etc...
- Storage : S3, EBS, EFS, etc...
- Analytics : Athena, RedShift.
- Development : Cloud9, code commit.
- Security : IAM, Macie, etc...
- Database : RDS, Dynamo DB.

Above are the most commonly used services in AWS and the services are not limited to the above list.

ðŸ“ŒWhat is Virtualization in AWS?
- Virtualization offers the capability of dividing the hardware resources on a physical server into a smaller units. These smaller units are named as Virtual machine(VM). These VM comes with different hardware configurations. 

ðŸ“ŒWhat are the Advantages of Cloud Computing?

There are many advantages of Cloud Computing.
- We can reach to the global audience in a few clicks of the button.
- No more spending money on running the data center and its maintenance.
- We get higher discount when committed to the longer duration.
- Provides lot of services to innovate and helps the SDLC process.
- No more guessing the capacity for any application.
- No upfront is amount required.

ðŸ“ŒLets understand few technical terms.
- High Availability âž¡The service should be always up and running.
- Elasticity âž¡Growing and Shrinking of the compute resources as per the need.
- Agility âž¡Provides various service to innovate faster and speed up the delivery of the product.
- Durability âž¡The data stored in the cloud will remain intact and will not be corrupted.

ðŸ“ŒCapital Expenditure(CapEx) vs Operational Expenditure(OpEx)
- CapEx âž¡Upfront cost towards purchasing the fixed assets.
- Assets such as Computer, Software's, Data Center Building, etc...
- OpEx âž¡Cost involved in running the day-to-day operations.
- Such as employee salary, Data Center rent, etc...
